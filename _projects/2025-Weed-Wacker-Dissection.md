As part of MAE 3230 at Cornell University, our team dissected and analyzed a gas-powered weed wacker to explore the fluid mechanics principles governing carburetor venturi flow. We measured critical dimensions, calculated flow velocities and Reynolds numbers, and applied Bernoulli's equation to explain how pressure differentials enable fuel delivery in small four-stroke engines.

## Project Overview

A weed wacker is essentially "a tiny, roaring helicopter on a stick"—with one squeeze of the trigger, the spinning string becomes a blur, slicing through grass and weeds. But what makes those little spinning strings so powerful? The answer lies inside the engine and all the components working behind the scenes, particularly the carburetor and its venturi system.

**Project Objectives:**
- Disassemble a complete 4-stroke weed wacker engine
- Create exploded view documentation of major components
- Measure carburetor venturi dimensions precisely
- Calculate air flow velocities using continuity equation
- Validate high Reynolds number approximation
- Apply Bernoulli's equation to explain fuel delivery mechanism
- Create educational video explaining fluid mechanics principles

## System Components

### Cooling Turbine

The cooling turbine directs airflow over the engine to remove heat generated by combustion and the spark plug's electrical system. The flywheel, with added mass around its perimeter, maintains smooth rotation and draws air through the volute—an Archimedean spiral-shaped housing that channels cooling airflow across the engine. 

The flywheel also contains a small magnet that generates an ignition spark each time it passes the coil, providing consistent timing for combustion.

### Four-Stroke Engine

![cam]({{ "/assets/images/weedwacker_cam.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}

The weed wacker uses a compact 4-stroke gasoline engine, which comes to life when the flywheel's spark initiates combustion. The engine follows the standard four-stroke cycle:

**Intake Stroke:**
The cam gear, linked to the crankshaft, opens the inlet valve. Because of the gear ratio between them, the cam gear rotates at a different angular velocity, allowing the valves to open and close at precisely the right moments. The air-fuel mixture from the carburetor enters the combustion chamber.

**Compression Stroke:**
The inlet valve closes, sealing the chamber while the mixture is compressed.

**Power Stroke:**
The spark plug ignites the mixture, forcing the piston downward—this is the power stroke that delivers mechanical work.

**Exhaust Stroke:**
On the next rotation, the exhaust valve opens, allowing the piston to push exhaust gases out through the exhaust port and out the two holes on the engine's side. Because combustion isn't perfectly efficient, a small amount of unburned fuel can exit with the exhaust.

## Carburetor and Venturi Analysis

![carburetor]({{ "/assets/images/weedwacker_carburetor.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}
![venturi]({{ "/assets/images/weedwacker_venturi.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-r}

A key component is the carburetor, where two inlet valves control air and fuel flow. Once opened, these allow both fluids to enter the venturi. Its converging–diverging shape creates subsonic, choked flow (Mach < 1), and the pressure drop at the throat pulls fuel into the airstream. This ensures the needed stoichiometric air–fuel ratio is delivered to the engine.

The venturi is the heart of our fluid mechanics analysis—a converging-diverging passage that uses geometry and flow velocity to create the pressure differential needed for passive fuel delivery.

## Fluid Mechanics Analysis

### Assumptions and Approximations

**Incompressible Flow Model:**
We assume the Mach number of the fluid flow always remains under 0.3 and the density does not change. We can therefore conclude that the flow is neither expanding nor contracting. This incompressible flow assumption allows us to use simplified continuity and Bernoulli equations.

**High Reynolds Number Approximation:**
As we'll calculate below, the Reynolds numbers in both the inlet and throat are above 3,000, allowing us to assume that viscosity is negligible and use inviscid flow equations.

### Venturi Geometry

Through careful measurement, we determined the venturi dimensions:

**Inlet diameter:** d₁ ≈ 5.5 inches = 0.1397 m  
**Throat diameter:** d₂ ≈ 4 inches = 0.1016 m

**Cross-sectional areas:**
```
A₁ = π/4 × d₁² = π/4 × (0.1397 m)² = 0.0153 m²
A₂ = π/4 × d₂² = π/4 × (0.1016 m)² = 0.0081 m²
```

### Continuity Equation Analysis

In the converging section of the venturi, we can use conservation of mass to prove that the speed of fluid flow increases at the throat:
```
ρ₁U₁A₁ = ρ₂U₂A₂
```

Because of the incompressible flow assumption, ρ₁ = ρ₂, so the densities cancel:
```
U₁A₁ = U₂A₂
```

We know that the throat has a smaller area, therefore the speed at the throat must be greater:
```
U₂/U₁ = A₁/A₂ = 0.0153/0.0081 = 1.89
```

**We can see that U₂ is almost twice the value of U₁.**

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### Flow Rate Calculation

To get the exact values of U₁ and U₂, we calculated the volumetric flow rate of air from its relationship to the engine RPM, piston area, and cylinder length.

**Engine and Piston Specifications:**
- Piston diameter: D_piston = 1.48 in = 3.76 cm = 0.0376 m
- Cylinder length: L_cylinder = 2.2 in = 5.588 cm = 0.05588 m
- Engine speed: ω_engine = 7000 rpm

**Piston area:**
```
A_piston = π/4 × D² = π/4 × (0.0376 m)² = 0.00111 m²
```

**Volumetric flow rate:**
```
Q = ω_engine × A_piston × L_cylinder
Q = 7000 rpm × (1 min/60 s) × 0.00111 m² × 0.05588 m
Q = 0.00724 m³/s
```

**Inlet velocity:**
```
U₁ = Q/A₁ = 0.00724 m³/s / 0.0153 m² = 0.472 m/s
```

**Throat velocity:**
```
U₂ = 1.89 × U₁ = 1.89 × 0.472 m/s = 0.892 m/s
```

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### Reynolds Number Validation

To validate our high Reynolds number approximation, we calculated Reynolds numbers at both locations. Let's assume this is before fuel gets mixed into air, so the only fluid of interest is air.

**Air properties:**
- Viscosity: μ_air = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵ Pa·s
- Density: ρ_air = 1.225 kg/m³

**Reynolds number at inlet:**
```
Re₁ = (ρ × U₁ × d₁) / μ
Re₁ = (1.225 kg/m³ × 0.472 m/s × 0.1397 m) / (1.8 × 10⁻⁵ Pa·s)
Re₁ = 4,488
```

**Reynolds number at throat:**
```
Re₂ = (ρ × U₂ × d₂) / μ
Re₂ = (1.225 kg/m³ × 0.892 m/s × 0.1016 m) / (1.8 × 10⁻⁵ Pa·s)
Re₂ = 6,171
```

**Both Reynolds numbers are above 3,000**, which allows us to use high Reynolds number approximations. This means we can assume that viscosity is negligible and use inviscid flow equations like Bernoulli's equation.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

## Bernoulli's Equation Application

The Bernoulli equation describes the pressure changes in the converging portion at high Reynolds number:
```
p₁ + ½ρU₁² + ρgz₁ = p₂ + ½ρU₂² + ρgz₂
```

**Key observations:**

Since z₁ = z₂ (no altitude change in the horizontal carburetor), the gravitational terms cancel:
```
p₁ + ½ρU₁² = p₂ + ½ρU₂²
```

We already know that U₂ ≈ 2U₁ from our continuity analysis. Rearranging Bernoulli's equation:
```
p₂ = p₁ + ½ρ(U₁² - U₂²)
p₂ = p₁ + ½ρ(U₁² - 4U₁²)
p₂ = p₁ - 1.5ρU₁²
```

**Therefore, p₂ < p₁**

This pressure decrease at the throat is what sucks the fuel into the venturi. The fuel jet is positioned at the throat where pressure is lowest, and atmospheric pressure in the fuel bowl pushes fuel through the jet into the low-pressure airstream.

**Physical mechanism:**
The pressure differential (p₁ - p₂) provides the driving force for fuel flow. As air accelerates through the converging section, its kinetic energy increases at the expense of pressure energy, creating suction that draws fuel into the airstream without requiring any mechanical pump.

## Design Considerations

You might wonder—why is the design as it is? Why not a bigger system?

**Size Trade-offs:**
A bigger engine allows for more power, but it would also make the tool heavier and harder to control. Handheld equipment must balance power requirements with user ergonomics and fatigue.

**Internal Geometry:**
The internal geometry matters just as much as the size. The shape and curvature of the carburetor passages control how air and fuel move, mix, and accelerate. 

**Surface Effects:**
Even the surface texture plays a role:
- **Rough surfaces** add turbulence and friction, increasing pressure losses
- **Smoother surfaces** support faster, cleaner flow with lower resistance

The venturi dimensions we measured represent an optimized balance:
- Throat area small enough to create sufficient pressure drop for fuel delivery
- But not so small as to excessively restrict airflow and limit power
- Convergence angle gradual enough to avoid flow separation
- Overall size compact enough for lightweight handheld operation

## Key Findings

**Velocity Amplification:**
The 1.89× area ratio between inlet and throat produces 1.89× velocity increase, demonstrating the direct relationship between geometry and flow behavior predicted by continuity.

**High Reynolds Number Flow:**
With Re > 4,000 throughout the carburetor, viscous effects are negligible. This validates using inviscid flow models (Bernoulli's equation) for analysis and design.

**Pressure-Driven Fuel Delivery:**
The ~75% pressure drop at the throat (based on Bernoulli's equation with U₂ = 2U₁) creates sufficient suction to draw fuel through calibrated jets without mechanical pumps. This passive fuel metering is reliable and simple.

**Subsonic Choked Flow:**
The converging-diverging venturi maintains Mach < 1 throughout, keeping the flow subsonic. This ensures predictable, controllable fuel delivery across the engine's operating range.

**Design Optimization:**
Every dimension matters—the 5.5" to 4" diameter reduction represents careful optimization balancing fuel delivery requirements, airflow capacity, and manufacturing constraints.

## Conclusion

This is just one of the many clever machines hiding in everyday life, and once you start noticing them, the world becomes a toolbox full of fluid mechanics in action.

From the Archimedean spiral cooling volute to the precision-engineered venturi throat, this compact weed wacker demonstrates how fundamental equations—continuity, Bernoulli, Reynolds number—govern real devices we use every day.

The five-minute dissection adventure revealed how a pressure drop of just a few hundred pascals, created by geometric convergence and velocity increase, enables reliable fuel delivery in a machine small enough to hold in one hand. That's the power of fluid mechanics in action.
