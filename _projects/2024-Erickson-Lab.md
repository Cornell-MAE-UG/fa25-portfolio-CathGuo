As an undergraduate researcher in the Erickson Lab at Cornell University, I contribute to the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices that combine microfluidics, biosensing, and smartphone imaging for accessible medical testing.

## FeverPhone: Hemorrhagic Fever Detection

My first major project focused on designing cassettes for the FeverPhone diagnostic system, which detects hemorrhagic fever viruses including Ebola (EBOV), Lassa (LASV), and Marburg (MARV) viruses. I designed and iteratively prototyped over 300 single- and triple-strip Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) cassettes using resin 3D printing.

The cassettes needed to precisely hold test strips while ensuring proper sample flow and creating optimal conditions for smartphone-based fluorescence imaging. Through multiple design iterations, I optimized the cassette geometry for:
- Consistent strip alignment and tension
- Minimal light leakage for fluorescence detection
- Easy sample loading and cassette handling
- Compatibility with various strip manufacturers

Each design iteration was validated through colorimetric assays to ensure reliable performance across different test conditions.

## PoCBreCa: Breast Cancer Biomarker Detection

For the PoCBreCa (Point-of-Care Breast Cancer) project, I developed three-channel cassette designs for simultaneous detection of multiple breast cancer biomarkers including Progesterone Receptor (PR), Estrogen Receptor (ER), and HER2.

This project introduced new challenges:
- **Multi-strip alignment**: Ensuring three strips remained parallel and properly spaced
- **Fluorophore detection**: Designing cassettes optimized for fluorescent signal capture rather than colorimetric readout
- **Sample distribution**: Creating channels that evenly distribute sample across all three test strips
- **Manufacturing feasibility**: Balancing design complexity with 3D printing constraints

The multi-channel design required careful attention to mechanical tolerances and material selection to prevent cross-contamination between channels while maintaining structural integrity.

## BioTracking: Commercial Cassette Integration

I designed a custom cassette tray system to integrate commercially available LFA strips into our smartphone-based imaging device. This adapter allows the platform to work with off-the-shelf test cassettes, greatly expanding the system's versatility.

The tray design focused on:
- Universal compatibility with various commercial cassette sizes
- Precise positioning for optimal imaging
- Quick cassette insertion and removal
- Light-tight enclosure for fluorescence imaging

This work demonstrates the ability to bridge custom research devices with existing commercial diagnostic products.

## ReproPhone: Reproductive Health Diagnostics

Currently, I'm developing a double-strip cassette system for the ReproPhone project, focused on reproductive health diagnostics. This design combines elements from previous projects while introducing new requirements:
- Dual-strip configuration for simultaneous multi-analyte testing
- Optimized geometry for hormone detection assays
- Improved sample handling for small volume specimens
- Enhanced manufacturability for potential scale-up

The double-strip format allows for internal controls or simultaneous detection of related biomarkers, improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

## Design Process & Methods

### CAD Modeling
All designs are created in Fusion 360, where I generate detailed 3D models, engineering drawings, and technical figures for research documentation and publications. I work closely with graduate students to understand their experimental requirements and translate them into functional designs.

### Rapid Prototyping
Using resin 3D printing (AnyCubic), I can quickly iterate through design variations, typically producing 5-10 test cassettes per design iteration. This rapid prototyping cycle allows for fast optimization based on experimental feedback.

### Validation Testing
Each design is validated through:
- **Colorimetric assays**: Testing with visible dye-based detection
- **Fluorescence assays**: Validation with fluorophore-labeled antibodies
- **Dimensional verification**: Ensuring manufacturing accuracy meets tolerances
- **User testing**: Getting feedback from lab members on handling and usability

### Documentation
I generate technical documentation including:
- Detailed CAD drawings with dimensions and tolerances
- Assembly instructions for lab members
- Design iteration notes tracking changes and rationale
- High-quality renderings for presentations and publications

## Impact & Applications

These diagnostic devices have potential applications in:
- **Resource-limited settings**: Low-cost, portable diagnostics without need for specialized equipment
- **Point-of-care testing**: Rapid results at the patient's location
- **Outbreak response**: Quick screening for infectious diseases in field settings
- **Cancer screening**: Accessible biomarker detection for early diagnosis
- **Reproductive health**: Private, at-home hormone monitoring

## Technical Skills Developed

Through this research, I've gained extensive experience in:
- Medical device design and prototyping
- Microfluidics and biosensor integration
- Design for manufacturability (DFM)
- Iterative engineering design process
- Cross-functional collaboration with biologists and clinicians
- Regulatory considerations for medical devices
- Scientific documentation and figure preparation
