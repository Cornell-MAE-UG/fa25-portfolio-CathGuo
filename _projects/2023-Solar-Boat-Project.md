As Hull Subteam Lead for Cornell University Solar Boat, I lead the design and fabrication of structural components for our solar-powered racing boat. This year, my primary focus has been designing and installing a new cable-driven steering system, while also contributing to cross-team integration efforts as we prepare for Solar Splash 2026. 

## Cable-Driven Steering System

My primary contribution this year has been designing and installing a new cable-driven steering system. Taking over this responsibility from the Drivetrain subteam, I developed a mechanical system that provides precise directional control for the pilot.

### Helm Assembly

The forward helm station features:
- **Steering wheel with pulley**: Mounted on wooden cross-beam structure for pilot access
- **Cable guides**: Small pulleys routing cables along the plywood framework

The wooden framework provides a sturdy mounting platform while keeping weight manageable and allowing easy modification during development.

### Cable Routing & Tensioning

The stern assembly connects the steering cables to the rudder mechanism:
- **Steel cables**: Braided stainless steel for strength and corrosion resistance
- **Turnbuckles**: For precise tension adjustment and cable length tuning
- **Cable clamps**: Secure terminations at connection points
- **Return spring**: Provides centering force and removes slack from the system
- **Aluminum mounting bracket**: Connects to motor mount structure

The cable routing runs along the hull interior, guided by pulleys to minimize friction and ensure smooth operation throughout the full range of rudder motion.

### System Integration

The complete installation integrates with:
- **Existing hull structure**: Foam hull with fiberglass cover
- **Motor mount**: Stern-mounted electric motor with propeller
- **Rudder assembly**: Mechanical linkage translating cable movement to rudder angle

The system was designed to work with the current hull, which was built before I joined the team, while being adaptable for the new hull we plan to fabricate next semester.

## Hull Development Planning

### Current Hull
The existing fiberglass hull provides a working platform for system development and testing. Working with this hull has allowed me to understand construction techniques and identify improvements for our next design.

### Next Semester Plans
Our subteam plans to design and fabricate a new hull for competition. I'm currently preparing by:
- **Learning simulation tools**: Self-studying CFD and structural analysis for hull design
- **Studying hull design concepts**: Understanding hydrodynamic principles and hull forms
- **Researching fabrication processes**: Evaluating construction methods for our application

Based on our test hull work, I've selected **wide plywood strips** as the approach for future hull fabrication, offering good strength-to-weight ratio with simpler construction compared to complex mold-based methods.

## Cross-Team Collaboration

Beyond hull responsibilities, I've contributed to several other subteams:

### Solar Panel Mounting (Solar Subteam)
Assisted with designing and fabricating mounting structures for the solar panels, ensuring secure attachment and proper orientation.

### Dashboard Design (Controls Subteam)
Helped design the pilot dashboard layout, considering instrument visibility, control accessibility, and ergonomics.

### Drivetrain Integration
Coordinated handoff of steering system responsibility and ensured compatibility with motor mounting and propeller shaft alignment.

## Team Leadership

As Hull Subteam Lead, my responsibilities include:
- Planning fabrication activities and setting milestones
- Coordinating material procurement
- Training team members on fabrication techniques
- Ensuring deliverables meet competition timeline
- Documenting processes for knowledge transfer

## Technical Skills Developed

Through this project, I've gained experience in:
- Cable-driven mechanical system design
- Steel cable termination and tensioning
- Mechanical system integration
- Working with composite structures
- Cross-functional team collaboration
- Project planning and scheduling

## Competition Goals

For Solar Splash 2026, our team objectives include:
- Reliable steering performance throughout all race events
- Successful integration of all subsystems
- Strong finishes in both sprint and endurance races

This project combines mechanical design with hands-on fabrication, providing experience in taking concepts from initial design through installation and testing. The work this year lays the foundation for next semester's hull design and fabrication, where I'll apply the simulation and design skills I'm currently developing.
