My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a passionate mechanical and aerospace engineering student at Cornell University. 

I’m deeply interested in mechanical design, medical devices, and robotics — especially how engineering design and experimentation can create real-world impact through innovation, precision, and creativity. 

I love working on hands-on projects that combine creativity and problem-solving — from designing components in Fusion 360 to machining, prototyping, and testing them in real life.  

Take a look at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv/">CV</a>.
