## About Me

<img src="{{ /assets/images/profile-pic.jpg | relative_url }}" />
 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a passionate mechanical and aerospace engineering student at Cornell University. 

I’m deeply interested in mechanical design, medical devices, and robotics — especially how engineering design and experimentation can create real-world impact through innovation, precision, and creativity. 

I love working on hands-on projects that combine creativity and problem-solving — from designing components in Fusion 360 to machining, prototyping, and testing them in real life.
